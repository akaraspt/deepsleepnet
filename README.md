# DeepSleepNet #
A deep learning model for automatic sleep stage scoring based on raw, single-channel EEG.

**We have published a more efficient deep learning model, named TinySleepNet, which is much smaller and can achieve a better scoring performance.**

## Environment ##

The following setup has been used to reproduce this work:

- Ubuntu 18.04 / Windows 10 1903 x64
- CUDA toolkit 10.0 and CuDNN v7.6.4
- Python 3.5.4 x64
- tensorflow-gpu (1.15.2)
- matplotlib (1.5.3)
- scikit-learn (0.19.1)
- scipy (1.4.1)
- numpy (1.18.2)
- pandas (0.25.3)
- mne (0.20.0)
- seaborn (0.9.1)
- [tensorlayer](https://github.com/zsdonghao/tensorlayer) (optional)
- MongoDB (optional)
- [eAE](https://github.com/aoehmichen/eae-docker) (optional)


## Prepare dataset ##
We evaluated our DeepSleepNet with MASS and [Sleep-EDF](https://physionet.org/pn4/sleep-edfx/) dataset.

For the MASS dataset, you have to request for a permission to access their dataset. 
For the [Sleep-EDF](https://physionet.org/pn4/sleep-edfx/) dataset, you can run the following scripts to download SC subjects.

    cd data
    chmod +x download_physionet.sh
    ./download_physionet.sh

Then run the following script to extract specified EEG channels and their corresponding sleep stages.

    python prepare_physionet.py --data_dir data --output_dir data/eeg_fpz_cz --select_ch 'EEG Fpz-Cz'
    python prepare_physionet.py --data_dir data --output_dir data/eeg_pz_oz --select_ch 'EEG Pz-Oz'


## Training a model ##
Run this script to train a DeepSleepNet model for the first fold of the 20-fold cross-validation.

    python train.py --data_dir data/eeg_fpz_cz --output_dir output --n_folds 20 --fold_idx 0 --pretrain_epochs 100 --finetune_epochs 200 --resume False

You need to train a DeepSleep model for every fold (i.e., `fold_idx=0...19`) before you can evaluate the performance. You can use the following script to run batch training

    chmod +x batch_train.sh
    ./batch_train.sh data/eeg_fpz_cz/ output 20 0 19 0


## Scoring sleep stages ##
Run this script to determine the sleep stages for the withheld subject for each cross-validation fold.

    python predict.py --data_dir data/eeg_fpz_cz --model_dir output --output_dir output

The output will be stored in numpy files.


## Get a summary ##
Run this script to show a summary of the performance of our DeepSleepNet compared with the state-of-the-art hand-engineering approaches. The performance metrics are overall accuracy, per-class F1-score, and macro F1-score.

    python summary.py --data_dir output


## Submit the job to the eAE cluster equipped with TensorLayer ##

1. Setup an eAE cluster (follows the instruction in this [link](https://github.com/aoehmichen/eae-docker))
2. Setup a MongoDB
3. Change location of MongoDB in `deepsleep/trainer.py`
4. Modify `submit_eAE.py`
5. Run `python submit_eAE.py`


## ToDo ##
- Release a version that does not depend on MongoDB and Tensorlayer (easier to install, but could take longer time for training).
